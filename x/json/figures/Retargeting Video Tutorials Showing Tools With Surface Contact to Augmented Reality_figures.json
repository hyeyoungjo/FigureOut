(left) The user extracts relevant\nmotion from the video, (middle) scales it and aligns the result to a 3D scan of a teapot in the current workspace. With our editing tools, the user can\nquickly alter the original tutorial to meet their requirements. In this example, the original video tutorial shows a decoration consisting of dots, which\nrequires a special henna pen. The user chooses to connect the dots into lines which can be drawn with a ceramic pen on the teapot. The user also scales\ndown the entire ornament to better \ufb01t the desired aesthetics.

Here, tracked features are\nused to record the path of the brush and to align a face model in each frame. (middle) After validating and possibly editing the extracted motion, we\nretarget the motion data to real world 3D objects. This requires registering the same 3D model as used in the extraction stage, in this case, a face model,\nto the live camera image. By tracking the model in 3D, we are able to relate video data to the real world. In this example, we present the recorded path\nof the brush directly on the user\u2019s face. (right) Since we retarget the extracted motion data in 3D, we can choose an arbitrary point of view. To provide\neffective visual instructions, we generate dynamic glyphs (here: timed arrows) and we indicate the position of the brush over time using a red circle.\n",
