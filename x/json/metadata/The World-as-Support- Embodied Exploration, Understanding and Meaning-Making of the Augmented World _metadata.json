Most  of  these \napplications  are  designed  based  on  the  Window-on-the-\nWorld (WoW) interaction paradigm. A significant decrease \nin cost of projection technology and advances in pico-sized \nprojectors  have \nspurred  applications  of  Projective \nAugmented  Reality.  This  research  has  focused  mainly  on \ntechnological development. However, there is still a need to \nits  communicational  and  expressive \nfully  understand \npotential.
