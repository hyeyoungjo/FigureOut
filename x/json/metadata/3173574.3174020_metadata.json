The  benefit  of  our \napproach  is  that  it  adds  physical  forces  while  keeping  the \nusers\u2019 hands free to interact unencumbered\u2014not only with \nvirtual objects, but also with physical objects, such as props \nand  appliances.  We  demonstrate  how  this  supports  three \nclasses  of  applications  along  the  mixed-reality  continuum: \n(1)  entirely  virtual  objects,  such  as  furniture  with  EMS \nfriction  when  pushed  or  an  EMS-based  catapult  game.  (2) \nVirtual  objects  augmented  via  passive  props  with  EMS-\nconstraints, such as a light control panel made tangible by \nmeans of a physical cup or a balance-the-marble game with \nan  actuated  tray.  (3)  Augmented  appliances  with  virtual \nbehaviors,  such  as  a  physical  thermostat  dial  with  EMS-\ndetents  or  an  escape-room  that  repurposes  lamps  as  levers \nwith detents. We present a user-study in which participants \nrated the EMS-feedback as significantly more realistic than \na no-EMS baseline. \nAuthor Keywords: games; mixed reality; EMS; \nACM  Classification  Keywords:  H5.2  [Information  inter-\nfaces  and  presentation]:  User  Interfaces.  -  Graphical  user \ninterfaces. \nINTRODUCTION \nAugmented Reality and Mixed Reality (AR/MR) interfaces \nallow  displaying  virtual  information  to  the  human  senses \nwhile  users  explore  the  real  world [16,44].  Researchers \nexplored  MR  to  overlay  data  [63],  assist  in  maintenance \ntasks [49,20] and virtually recreate physical games [31]. \nAs  the  next  step  towards  realism  and  immersion,  many \nresearchers argue that MR systems should also support the \nhaptic sense in order to convey the physicality of the virtual \nworld  [64],  to  better  \u201cblend\u201d  both  realities  [44,  22]  and  to \nincrease the user\u2019s sense of agency [42].",
