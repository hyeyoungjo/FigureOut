To create immersive VR experiences\nand to study the interaction in VR, it is, therefore, crucial to\nreliably measure presence. Previous work developed increas-\ningly sophisticated approaches to assess presence. While\nmultiple physiological measures have been proposed [18],\nvalidated questionnaires are still the most common method\nfor measuring this construct [10]. Using different items and\nsubscales such questionnaires provide scores, which reflect\nthe level of felt presence in the virtual world (cf. Table 1).\nThe use of validated presence questionnaires is omnipre-\nsent in research and industry. These standardized question-\nnaires are filled in using pen and paper. Typical studies re-\npeatedly assess presence, especially when multiple VR ex-\nperiences are compared. As current VR experiences are pre-\nsented through head-mounted displays (HMDs), users must\nremove the headset and leave the VR before completing the\nquestionnaire. In doing so, the person has to re-orientate in\nthe real-world which causes a so-called \u201cbreak-in-presence\n(BIP)\u201d [11]. Slater and Steed describe it as a moment when\n\u201ca report can be given that a break has occurred without this\nin itself disturbing the sense of presence, which of course\nhas already been disturbed\u201d [36]. This means that surveying\nsubjects about their feeling of presence potentially causes\nthe BIP and compromises the phenomenon that the ques-\ntionnaire is supposed to be measuring [26, 34, 36].\nLeaving VR can cause BIPs which distort the phenomenon\nthat presence questionnaires measure [26, 34, 36]. Further-\nmore, leaving and re-entering the VR takes time not only\nbecause it requires removing and putting on the HMDs but\nalso reorientation in the real-world and when entering the\nVR experience again.\nInstead of requiring participants to leave the VR to fill in\nquestionnaires, we propose to survey participants directly\nwithin the VR using existing questionnaires. Surveying par-\nticipants during the VR experience have a number of poten-\ntial advantages:",
