All \nleverage  various  modalities  to  provide  their  users  with \ndiverse  experiences in immersive virtual environments.  By \ntheir nature, these immersive experiences can result in users \nlosing  connectedness  with  the  real  world,  including  by \ndimming their awareness of incoming calls, text messages, \nand other phone notifications. Far from wanting to fully drop \nout of reality, however, VR users may desire to be notified \nabout real-world events such as messages, and in some cases \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or \nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed \nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation \non the first page.
