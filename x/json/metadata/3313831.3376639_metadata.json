    "abstract": "Throwing is a fundamental movement in many sports and games. Given this, accurate throwing in VR applications today is surprisingly difficult. In this paper we explore the nature of the difficulties of throwing in VR in more detail. We present the results of a user study comparing throwing in VR and in the physical world. In a short pre-study with 3 participants we determine an optimal number of throwing repetitions for the main study by exploring the learning curve and subjective fatigue of throwing in VR. In the main study, with 12 participants, we find that throwing precision and accuracy in VR are lower particularly in the distance and height dimensions. It also requires more effort and exhibits different kinematic patterns.",
