In  this  paper,  we  describe  a  science  museum \nexhibit that enables visitors to make circuits on an interactive \ntabletop  and  observe  a  simulation  of  electrons  flowing \nthrough \nto  use  multiple \nrepresentations to help convey basic concepts of current and \nresistance.  To  study  visitor  interaction  and  learning,  we \ntested  the  design  at  a  popular  science  museum  with  60 \nparent-child  dyads  in  three  conditions:  a  control  condition \nwith no electron simulation; a condition with the simulation \ndisplayed  alongside  the  circuit  on  the  same  screen;  and  an \naugmented  reality  condition, with  the  simulation  displayed \non  a  tablet  that  acts  as  a  lens  to  see  into  the  circuit.

One \nstream of studies has shown that novices have an insufficient \nunderstanding  of  what  happens  at  the  level  of  atoms  and \nelectrons in a circuit [9, 30, 34]. For example, learners might \nPermission  to  make  digital  or  hard  copies  of  all  or  part  of  this  work  for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear  this  notice  and  the  full  citation  on  the  first  page.

    "paragraph_after_keyword": "think of current as something like water in a pipe that flows \nout  of  the  battery  and  encounters  each  component  in  turn  \n[30]. Or, they might think of current as a substance that gets \nconsumed by things like lightbulbs and resistors. And, while \nthese  models  have  some  value  for  understanding  electrical \nphenomena, they differ from the scientific understanding in \nways that makes it difficult to predict things like the relative \nbrightness of lightbulbs in a series circuit (e.g. Figure 5).  \nOne promising strategy to help learners understand circuits \nis  to  provide  dynamic  visual  representations  of  electrical \nconcepts [15, 34]. For example, Frederiksen et al. explored \ndifferent  ways  of  visualizing  the  concept  of  voltage  for \nlearners by relating it to the distribution of charged particles \nin a circuit [15]. In another example, Sengupta and Wilesnky \n[34] created an agent-based representation of current based \non Drude\u2019s model. In this model, a cloud of free electrons \nhas  a  net  movement  through  a  circuit  when  a  potential \ndifference  is  applied.  Simple  kinetic  interactions  between \nfree  electrons  and  ions  in  conductive  materials  result  in \nemergent properties that approximate Ohm\u2019s law (see [34]). \nResearch  has  shown  that  this  kind  of  electron-level \nrepresentation  along  with  structured  curriculum  can  help \nstudents  develop  more  sophisticated  understandings  of \nsimple circuits [35]. \nIn this paper, we present the design and evaluation of Spark, \nan augmented circuit exhibit for science museums (Figures \n1-3). Spark combines a virtual circuit building environment \nwith  a  simulation  of  current  flow  based  on  Sengupta  and \nWilensky\u2019s instantiation of Drude\u2019s model.
