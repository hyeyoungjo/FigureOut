With \nrecreational  VR  applications  coming  to  the  market  for \ndementia, we must consider how VR experiences for people \nwith  dementia  can  be  sensitively  designed  to  provide \ncomfortable and enriching experiences. Working  with  seven \nparticipants  from  a  local  dementia  care  charity,  we  outline \nsome  of  the  opportunities  and  challenges  inherent  to  the \ndesign and use of VR experiences with people with dementia \nand  their  carers  through  an  inductive  thematic  analysis.  We \nalso provide a series of future directions for work in VR and \ndementia:  1)  careful  physical  design,  2)  making  room  for \nsharing,  3)  utilizing  all  senses,  4)  personalization,  and  5) \npositioning the person with dementia as an active participant. \nAuthor Keywords \nDementia; care; virtual reality; augmented reality; creativity; \nexperience; expression.  \nACM Classification Keywords \nH.5.m. Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI). \nINTRODUCTION \nAn initial focus in dementia and design research has been the \ntackling  of  cognitive  deficits  and  other  behavioural \nsymptoms  in  people  with  dementia  [37];  however,  more \nrecent  research  has  followed  more  social  and  interpersonal \nlines,  by  paying  attention  to  networks  of  care  and  aesthetic \nexperience  in  dementia  [39].  A  similar  initial  focus  on \nmedicalisation has been faced by the development of virtual \nreality  for  clinical  populations  [12].  Virtual  reality  refers  to \nthe  computer-generated  simulation  of  a  three-dimensional \nenvironment  that  can  be  interacted  with  by  a  person  using \nequipment  such  as  head-mounted  displays  (HMDs)  or  VR \ngloves  [54,  32].  For  those  facing  neurological  impairments \nsuch  as  acquired  brain  injury  through  to  learning  disorders; \nneurological  rehabilitation  through  VR  has  been  a  well-",
