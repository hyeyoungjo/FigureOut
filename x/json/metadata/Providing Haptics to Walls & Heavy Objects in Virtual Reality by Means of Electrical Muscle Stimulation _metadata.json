When a user tries to push such an \nobject,  our  system  actuates  the  user\u2019s  shoulder,  arm,  and \nwrist  muscles  by  means  of  electrical  muscle  stimulation, \ncreating a counter force that pulls the user's arm backwards. \nOur device accomplishes this in a wearable form factor. \nIn our first user study, participants wearing a head-mounted \ndisplay  interacted  with  objects  provided  with  different \ntypes  of  EMS  effects.  The  repulsion  design  (visualized  as \nan electrical field) and the soft design (visualized as a mag-\nnetic  field)  received  high  scores  on  \u201cprevented  me  from \npassing through\u201d as well as \u201crealistic.\u201d \nIn a second study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our \napproach  by  letting  participants  explore  a  virtual  world  in \nwhich  all  objects  provide  haptic  EMS  effects,  including \nwalls, gates, sliders, boxes, and projectiles. \nAuthor Keywords \nMuscle interfaces; virtual reality; EMS; force feedback. \nACM Classification Keywords  \nH5.2 [Information interfaces and presentation]: User Inter-\nfaces. - Graphical user interfaces. \nINTRODUCTION \nRecent virtual reality systems allow users to walk freely in \nthe virtual world (aka real walking [36]). As the next step \ntowards  realism  and  immersion,  many  researchers  argue \nthat  these  systems  should  also  support  the  haptic  sense  in \norder to convey the physicality of the virtual world [3,4].  \nThere has been a good amount of progress towards simulat-\ning the haptic qualities of lightweight objects, such as con-\ntact  with  surfaces  [17]  or  textures  [8].  Solutions  generally \nrevolve around simulating the tactile qualities of the object, \ni.e., how the object affects the receptors in the user\u2019s skin.\nThese  include  inflatable  pads  at  the  user\u2019s  fingertips [20], \nvibro-tactile gloves [5], and glove exoskeletons [17].",
