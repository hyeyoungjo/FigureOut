But even experienced mobile app de-\nsigners face signi\ufb01cant challenges: creating 2D/3D AR con-\ntent remains dif\ufb01cult and time-consuming, and current mobile\nprototyping tools do not support AR views. There are sepa-\nrate tools for this; however, they require signi\ufb01cant technical\nskill. This paper presents ProtoAR which supplements rapid\nphysical prototyping using paper and Play-Doh with new mo-\nbile cross-device multi-layer authoring and interactive cap-\nture tools to generate mobile screens and AR overlays from\npaper sketches, and quasi-3D content from 360\u25e6 captures of\nclay models. We describe how ProtoAR evolved over four\ndesign jams with students to enable interactive prototypes of\nmobile AR apps in less than 90 minutes, and discuss the ad-\nvantages and insights ProtoAR can give designers.\nAuthor Keywords\nmobile augmented reality; physical-digital prototyping;\nquasi-3D 360\u25e6 captures.\nACM Classi\ufb01cation Keywords\nH.5.2.

Previously, special hard-\nware and extensive instrumentation of user and environment\nwere required, but the latest technologies like Apple ARKit\nand Google ARCore enable AR on existing smartphones.\nThis facilitates a new generation of mobile interfaces that are\nno longer limited to apps living in a purely digital form on\nthe device. Instead, the device becomes a lens into the virtual\nworld, making use of a user\u2019s physical environment to aug-\nment their view with digital content. For example, IKEA\u2019s\nPlace app gives users previews of how new furniture \ufb01ts into\ntheir homes before committing to the purchase and assembly.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor pro\ufb01t or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the \ufb01rst page.

    "paragraph_after_keyword": "This research considers the signi\ufb01cance of these develop-\nments and the new need for more AR designers. The main\nproblem is that interaction designers, who in today\u2019s world\nplay a key role in user experience design, are not equipped\nwith the toolbox to design tomorrow\u2019s AR interfaces. A\nsigni\ufb01cant part of the problem is that existing research has\nmostly focused on technical aspects of AR as a new technol-\nogy [2, 3, 25, 40]. AR as a new medium for interaction de-\nsigners has received much less attention [24]. These design-\ners are guided by principles such as affordances, mappings,\nand constraints [30]. But in this new design world that mixes\nthe physical and the digital, there are no established design\nrules and only a limited understanding of the kinds of interac-\ntions that users would \ufb01nd intuitive and natural [32]. We are\nnot the \ufb01rst to recognize this need for AR tools to empower\ninteraction designers, but other than DART [24] there are not\nmany good examples. Even advanced commercial tools\u2014\nInVision, Sketch, and Adobe XD\u2014do not provide access to\nphone cameras as a basic requirement for mobile AR.\nExisting research has focused on new digital tools like DART\nto create AR interfaces without programming. However,\ncreating 2D/3D digital content for AR remains dif\ufb01cult and\ntime-consuming [10]. When designing mobile apps, paper\nprototypes [33, 35] are typically the starting point, but this\nseems too limiting for AR [13]. To address this, we explore\nhow working with modeling compounds like Play-Doh could\ncomplement paper prototyping to create props that could later\nbe substituted with higher quality digital 3D content.\nThis paper presents the ProtoAR tool designed to investi-\ngate lightweight and creative ways to quickly transition from\nphysical to digital prototyping of mobile AR apps. There are\ntwo key innovations in ProtoAR: (i) cross-device multi-layer\nauthoring tools for live editing of mobile AR apps on phones;\n(ii) interactive capture tools to generate mobile screens or AR\noverlays from paper sketches, and 3D models from Play-Doh.\nWe offer three main contributions with ProtoAR:\n\u2022 the design and study of ProtoAR as a mobile AR live proto-\ntyping tool that extends cross-device authoring techniques\n[6, 11, 12, 27, 28, 29] to AR interface design;\n\u2022 simple and fast techniques for digitizing paper mockups\nand Play-Doh models without the need for special hard-\nware or expensive algorithms for 3D scanning [14];\n\u2022 initial explorations of the design space of mobile AR apps\nthat can be developed using a tool like ProtoAR and how it\ncould expand to more advanced prototypes in the future."
