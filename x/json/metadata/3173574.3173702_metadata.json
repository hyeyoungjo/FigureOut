One of the big advan-\ntages of VR HMDs is the level of presence and immersion\nthey are capable of creating. While prior research on VR has\ntraditionally focused on technical or visual aspects to increase\nthe immersion, haptics has recently been identi\ufb01ed as one of\nthe missing aspects which has also a signi\ufb01cant impact on im-\nmersion and presence. In this paper we focus on one speci\ufb01c\naspect of haptics, namely weight.\nCurrently, there are two approaches to simulate weight in VR,\neither using a physical actuator [21, 2, 31] or through visual\nindicators [15, 16, 22, 23]. A drawback of physical actuators\nis that they require a modi\ufb01cation of the used controllers, and\nthat there is currently no technology or mechanism which is\ncapable of fully and realistically simulating the sensation of\nweight. Software modi\ufb01cations share the advantage that they\ncan be applied in most of the currently available VR devices,\nbut are limited in their expressiveness in creating a perception\nof weight, since visual cues are used as subtle as possible to\nlet users be unaware of any manipulation. In this paper, we\npresent a software based approach capable of simulating a\nvisual and a haptic perception of weight for tracking-based\nVR devices (e.g. Oculus Rift, HTC VIVE).",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) technology strives to enable a highly immersive experience for the user by including a wide variety of modalities (e.g. visuals, haptics). Current VR hardware however lacks a sufficient way of communicating the perception of weight of an object, resulting in scenarios where users can not distinguish between lifting a bowling ball or a feather. We propose a solely software based approach of simulating weight in VR by deliberately using perceivable tracking offsets. These tracking offsets nudge users to lift their arm higher and result in a visual and haptic perception of weight. We conducted two user studies showing that participants intuitively associated them with the sensation of weight and accept them as part of the virtual world. We further show that compared to no weight simulation, our approach led to significantly higher levels of presence, immersion and enjoyment. Finally, we report perceptional thresholds and offset boundaries as design guidelines for practitioners.",
