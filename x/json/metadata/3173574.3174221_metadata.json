While\nthe technology for input as well as output devices is market\nready, only a few solutions for text input exist, and empirical\nknowledge about performance and user preferences is lacking.\nIn this paper, we study text entry in VR by selecting characters\non a virtual keyboard. We discuss the design space for assess-\ning selection-based text entry in VR. Then, we implement six\nmethods that span different parts of the design space and eval-\nuate their performance and user preferences. Our results show\nthat pointing using tracked hand-held controllers outperforms\nall other methods. Other methods such as head pointing can be\nviable alternatives depending on available resources. We sum-\nmarize our \ufb01ndings by formulating guidelines for choosing\noptimal virtual keyboard text entry methods in VR.\nACM Classi\ufb01cation Keywords\nH.5.m.
