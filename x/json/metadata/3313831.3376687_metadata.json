For example, large arm swinging \nor reaching movements in VR when seated at a desk could \nresult in damage to equipment or personal injury. Furthermore, \nextensive movement in VR may be uncomfortable or even \nimpossible for users with mobility issues. \nA typical remedy to this problem is input amplifcation: trans-\nforming smaller, more comfortable movements into the larger, \nmore dramatic movements that the user expects.  However, \nmany of these techniques come at a cost. Typical amplifcation \ntechniques allow the user to manipulate objects at distances \nmuch further than a typical arm\u2019s reach [3,15,25]. This unreal-\nistic increase in reach comes at the expense of body ownership \n\u2014 the psychological mapping of one\u2019s real body to a virtual \nbody [29] \u2014 detracting from the user\u2019s feeling of presence",

    "abstract": "Input amplification enables easier movement in virtual reality (VR) for users with mobility issues or in confined spaces. However, current techniques either do not focus on maintaining feelings of body ownership, or are not applicable to general VR tasks. We investigate a general purpose non-linear transfer function that keeps the user's reach within reasonable bounds to maintain body ownership. The technique amplifies smaller movements from a user-definable neutral point into the expected larger movements using a configurable Hermite curve. Two experiments evaluate the approach. The first establishes that the technique has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, increasing physical comfort while maintaining task performance and body ownership. The second explores the characteristics of the technique over a wide range of amplification levels. Using the combined results, design and implementation recommendations are provided with potential applications to related VR transfer functions.",
