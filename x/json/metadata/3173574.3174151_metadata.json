In this paper, we\npresent Season Traveller, a multisensory virtual reality (VR)\nnarration of a journey through four seasons within a mystical\nrealm. By adding olfactory and haptic (thermal and wind)\nstimuli, we extend traditional audio-visual VR technologies\nto achieve enhanced sensory engagement within interactive\nexperiences. Using both subjective measures of presence and\nelicited physiological responses, we evaluated the impact of\ndifferent modalities on the virtual experience. Our results in-\ndicate that 1) the addition of any singular modality improves\nsense of presence with respect to traditional audio-visual ex-\nperiences and 2) providing a combination of these modalities\nproduces a further signi\ufb01cant enhancement over the aforemen-\ntioned improvements. Furthermore, insights into participants\u2019\npsychophysiology were extrapolated from electrodermal activ-\nity (EDA) and heart rate (HR) measurements during each of\nthe VR experiences.\nACM Classi\ufb01cation Keywords\nH.5.m.
