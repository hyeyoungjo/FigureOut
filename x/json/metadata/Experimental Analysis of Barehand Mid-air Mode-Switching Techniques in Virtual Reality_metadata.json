    "paragraph_after_keyword": "from those it would produce in other settings [68]. Mode-\nswitching is simply the transition from one mode to another.\nModes are common in all interfaces, including interfaces\nfor Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). For\nexample, a hand gesture-based 3D modelling application\nmay have different modes for object creation, selection, and\ntransformation. Depending on the mode, the movement of\nthe hand is interpreted differently. Completing a task typi-\ncally requires frequent mode-switching, so understanding\nthe performance of different methods is important.\nIn VR, bare hand mid-air input is an alternative to device\ncontrollers. Techniques have been proposed for VR, AR, and\nrelated contexts using hands only (e.g. [61, 64, 93]) and hands\ncombined with body postures (e.g. [12, 100]). Evaluations\nhave focused on tasks like pointing (e.g. [99]), object manip-\nulation (e.g. [69]), selection (e.g. [59]), and annotation [16],\nbut no extensive comparisons of mode-switching techniques\nhave been performed yet. Mode-switching techniques for\nmice [18], styli [48, 88], and touch [83] have been evaluated,\nbut generalizing those results to 3D environments like VR is\nnot straightforward.\nWe provide missing empirical evidence for the perfor-\nmance of bare hand mid-air mode-switching techniques in\nVR. Our focus is absolute, single-point input, suitable for the\nkind of direct object manipulations common in VR such as\npointing at, grabbing and moving 3D elements in the virtual\nenvironment. To select techniques to evaluate, we examined\nbare hand mid-air interaction in different settings, then used\nthree criteria to identify six classes of techniques suitable for\nmode-switching in VR. In two related experiments, we com-\npare common input actions selected from each class using an\nadapted \u201csubtraction method\u201d protocol [18], used previously\nfor 2D input.\nThe first experiment compares seven techniques, with\na dominant-hand pinch as the fundamental manipulation\ntrigger. The mode-switching techniques include three dom-\ninant hand postures: a fist, an open palm and pointing the\nindex finger; and four non-dominant hand postures: a fist,\nan open palm, bringing the hand into the field-of-view and\ntouching the head. As a comparison baseline, the button of a\ndevice controller held in the non-dominant hand was also",
