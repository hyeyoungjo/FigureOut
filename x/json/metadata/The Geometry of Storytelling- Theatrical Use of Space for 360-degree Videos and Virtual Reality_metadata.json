Theatre practitioners\u2019 expertise in manipulating spatial\ninteractions has much to contribute to immersive recorded\ncontent. Four theatre directors led teams of three actors to\nstage the same scene for both immersive theatre and for 360-\ndegree \ufb01lming. Each team was recorded performing the scene\nat least six times, three in each condition, to extract actors\u2019\ncoordinates. This study establishes how to quantify theatre\npractitioners\u2019 use of spatial interactions and examines the\nspatial adaptations made when transferring these relationships\nto 360-degree \ufb01lming.\nStaging for a 360-degree camera compared to staging for\nan audience member had shorter distances from the camera\nand between performers, along with fewer instances of the\ncamera being in the middle of the action. Across all groups,\ninterpersonal distance between characters and between the\naudience/camera dropped at the end of the scene when the\ncharacters come together as a team, suggesting that elements\nof Proxemics may be applicable to narrative performance.\nACM Classi\ufb01cation Keywords\nJ.5 Computer Applications: Arts and Humanities, Performing\narts; H.5.1 Information Systems: Multimedia Information\nSystems\nAuthor Keywords\nVirtual Reality; Narrative; Theatre; Performance; Cinematic\nVR; Interpersonal Space; Head-Mounted Display; Work\ufb02ow;\n360-degree video\nINTRODUCTION\nThe \ufb01rst head-mounted display (HMD), nicknamed \u2018Sword\nof Damocles\u2019 because of the bulky and alarming apparatus\nprecariously perched above the viewer, was developed in 1968",
