An important\npart of this presence is interaction; people in an immersive\nVR environment need to be able to interact realistically with\nthe objects in the environment in order not to break the illu-\nsion of immersion in an alternate reality [37]. Presumably, in\norder to produce high-fidelity interaction in immersive VR\nenvironments, we also need an understanding of the issues\nof human physical interaction in the real world.\nFrom research in psychology and philosophy, we know\nthat interaction with objects of the environment is mediated\nby the physicality of our body [8, 9, 11, 29]. I.e., interaction in\nthis context is not only a matter of how an external object is\nperceived by the person\u2019s sensory mechanisms but, perhaps\nmore importantly, involves how the human body itself affects\nthe physical object and how the overall interplay between\nboth the object and the body is processed by the brain.\nTo make things more complex, interaction with both phys-\nical and virtual objects is often mediated by tools. Tools are\nobjects themselves that serve as intermediaries between our\nbodies and other objects that we intend to modify (e.g., we\ncan use a stick in our hand to topple a vase that is out of\nour reach). Tools are particularly interesting in the context\nof human-computer interaction for two main reasons: first,\nVR interaction is often implemented through the use of in-\nput devices (e.g., the Oculus Touch VR Controller), which are\nthemselves presented in VR as tools that mediate interaction\nwith virtual objects. Second, from evidence in psychology\nand theories from philosophy, we know that tools become,\nin some ways, extensions of our own body when sufficient\nproficiency with the tool has been achieved. We know, for\nexample, that experts often refer to their tools as \u201calmost part\nof their own bodies\u201d, and that psychologists have found ev-\nidence that tool use can produce changes in body perception",
