In  our \nstudy,  we  presented  an  image  of  a  rectangular  prism  on  a \ncylindrical  and  a  flat  display.  Participants  were  asked  to \nmove  their  index  finger  horizontally  along  the  surface  of \nthe  displays  towards  the  edge  of  the  rectangular  prism. \nParticipants  were  asked  whether  they  were  experiencing  a \nflat,  cylindrical  or  rectangular  shape.  In  one  condition,  a \nvibrotactile  stimulus  simulated  increasing  friction  towards \nthe  visible  edge  of  the  rectangular  prism,  with  a  sudden \ndrop-off when this edge was crossed by the finger. Results \nsuggest that presenting an image of a rectangular prism, and \napplying  vibrotactile  friction,  particularly  on  a  cylindrical \ndisplay,  significantly  increased  participant  ratings  stating \nthat they were experiencing a physical rectangular shape. \nAuthor Keywords \nOrganic User Interfaces; DisplayObjects; Shaped Displays; \nVibrotactile Feedback.  \nACM Classification Keywords \nH.5.m.

[9],  when  assessing  the  physical \nproperties  of  objects,  users  combine  visual  and  haptic \ninformation in an integral way. This allows users to not just \nassess  visual  affordances  of  the  object,  but  also  physical \nproperties \nshape,  weight,  weight  distribution, \ntemperature,  texture  and  other  material  properties.  Such \nhaptic properties are sensed through receptors in the skin of \nthe  fingertips  as  well  as  by  mechanoreceptors  in  muscle, \ntendons  and  joints  that  provide  kinesthetic  feedback  [23]. \nWhile  there  has  been  a  substantial  amount  of  work \nperformed  on  the  simulation  of  kinesthetic  properties  in \nVirtual Reality systems [31,12,18] and vibrotactile [13] and",
