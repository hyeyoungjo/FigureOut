This  paper \ninvestigates if and how the virtual enactment of two renowned \nmoral dilemmas\u2014the Trolley and the Mad Bomber\u2014in\ufb02uence \ndecision-making when compared with mentally visualizing \nsuch  situations.  We  conducted  two  user  studies  with  two \ngender-balanced samples of 60 participants in total that com-\npared between paper-based and virtual-reality (VR) conditions, \nwhile simulating 5 distinct scenarios for the Trolley dilemma, \nand 4 storyline scenarios for the Mad Bomber\u2019s dilemma. Our \n\ufb01ndings suggest that the VR enactment of moral dilemmas \nfurther fosters utilitarian decision-making, while it ampli\ufb01es \nbiases such as sparing juveniles and seeking retribution. Ulti-\nmately, we theorize that the VR enactment of renowned moral \ndilemmas can yield ecologically-valid data for training future \nArti\ufb01cial Intelligence (AI) systems on ethical decision-making, \nand we elicit early design principles for the training of such \nsystems. \nAuthor Keywords \nEthics; moral dilemmas; VR; decision-making; ethical AI. \nCCS Concepts \n\u2022Human-centered  computing  \u2192  Human  computer  inter-\naction (HCI); Virtual reality; User studies; \nINTRODUCTION \nHumanity has been continuously confronted with moral dilem-\n \n \nmas ever since the dawn of logical reasoning, dating back to \n \nthe classical era in ancient Greece (5th and 4th centuries BC). \nOver time, several schools of thought emerged including the \n \nCynics, the Cyrenaics, Aristotle\u2019s school of ethics, the Epicure-\n \nans and the Stoics, holistically described as \u201cAncient Ethics\u201d; \n \n \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or \n \n \n \n \nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed \n \nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation \n \n \n \n \non  the  first  page.
