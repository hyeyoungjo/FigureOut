While researchers\nhave long seen the potential of VR technology for educational\napplications [7, 12] and therapeutic bene\ufb01ts [46, 33], they have\nonly limited knowledge about what facilitates these immersive\nVR experiences, and speci\ufb01cally how audio contributes to\nthese impressions.

    "abstract": "Sound and virtual reality (VR) are two important output modalities for creating an immersive player experience (PX). While prior research suggests that sounds might contribute to a more immersive experience in games played on screens and mobile displays, there is not yet evidence of these effects of sound on PX in VR. To address this, we conducted a within-subjects experiment using a commercial horror-adventure game to study the effects of a VR and monitor-display version of the same game on PX. Subsequently, we explored, in a between-subjects study, the effects of audio dimensionality on PX in VR. Results indicate that audio has a more implicit influence on PX in VR because of the impact of the overall sensory experience and that audio dimensionality in VR may not be a significant factor contributing to PX. Based on our findings and observations, we provide five design guidelines for VR games.",
