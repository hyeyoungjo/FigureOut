This discrepancy needs to be overcome using ar-\nti\ufb01cial locomotion. Current approaches in standard consumer \napplications rely mainly on third party controllers or the two \ncontrollers present with most VR devices on the market. Lo-\ncomotion is either realized via direct motion or teleportation, \nboth rely on button inputs and controller or head-mounted \ndisplay (HMD) positions. \nHowever, the hands are usually used for interaction, the head \nfor exploration, and feet for locomotion. While hands and head \ncan naturally be used for their real world purposes in VR, feet \nare still a neglected input modality. In this paper we explored \npossible input modalities relying on feet for locomotion input, \nto more naturally distribute task to the users\u2019 interaction habits. \nAn established group of approaches utilizing feet for loco-\nmotion in VR is redirected walking. Locomotion relying on \nredirected walking lets the user explore the world around them \nfreely by walking around. However, the user\u2019s walking path is",

    "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) allows for infinitely large environments. However, the physical traversable space is always limited by real-world boundaries. This discrepancy between physical and virtual dimensions renders traditional locomotion methods used in real world unfeasible. To alleviate these limitations, research proposed various artificial locomotion concepts such as teleportation, treadmills, and redirected walking. However, these concepts occupy the user's hands, require complex hardware or large physical spaces. In this paper, we contribute nine VR locomotion concepts for foot-based locomotion, relying on the 3D position of the user's feet and the pressure applied to the sole as input modalities. We evaluate our concepts and compare them to state-of-the-art point &amp; teleport technique in a controlled experiment with 20 participants. The results confirm the viability of our approaches for foot-based and engaging locomotion. Further, based on the findings, we contribute a wireless hardware prototype implementation.",
