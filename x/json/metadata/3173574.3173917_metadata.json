The ultimate VR might look \nlike  lucid  dreaming,  the  phenomenon  of  knowing  one  is \ndreaming while in the dream. Lucid dreaming can be used \nas  an  introspective  tool  and,  ultimately,  increase  mental \nwell-being.  What  these  introspective  experiences  are  like \nfor  lucid  dreamers  might  be  key  in  determining  specific \ndesign guidelines for future creation of a technological tool \nused  for  helping  people  examine  their  own  thoughts  and \nemotions.

Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI): \nMiscellaneous  \nINTRODUCTION \nTechnology  is  becoming  more  and  more  ingrained  in  our \nevery day lives, yet it is only recently that HCI researchers, \ntechnologists and designers have paused to think about how \nthese  technologies  could  be  used  to  better  our  lives  and \nincrease  our  well-being  [2,23,53,61].  While  many  mobile \napplications  designed  for  this  purpose  exist  [43],  one  area \nthat  is  still  largely  unexplored  is  virtual  reality  (VR).
