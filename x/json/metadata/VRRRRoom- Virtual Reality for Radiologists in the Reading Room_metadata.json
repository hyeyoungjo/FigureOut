Indeed,\nserious diagnostic errors can appear when observing images\nthrough everyday monitors. Typically, these occur whenever\nprofessionals are ill-positioned with respect to the display or\nvisualize images under improper light and luminance condi-\ntions. In this work, we show that virtual reality can assist\nradiodiagnostics by considerably diminishing or cancel out\nthe effects of unsuitable ambient conditions. Our approach\ncombines immersive head-mounted displays with interactive\nsurfaces to support professional radiologists in analyzing med-\nical images and formulating diagnostics. We evaluated our\nprototype with two senior medical doctors and four seasoned\nradiology fellows. Results indicate that our approach consti-\ntutes a viable, \ufb02exible, portable and cost-ef\ufb01cient option to\ntraditional radiology reading rooms.\nACM Classi\ufb01cation Keywords\nH.5.2 Information Interfaces and Presentation (e.g. HCI):\nInteraction styles, Graphical User Interfaces\nAuthor Keywords\nVirtual Reality; Multitouch Surfaces; Medical Visualization;\nInteraction Design",
