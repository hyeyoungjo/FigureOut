    "paragraph_containing_keyword": "ABSTRACT  \nIn  HCI,  the  honeypot  efect  describes  a  form  of  audience  en-\ngagement  in  which  a  person\u2019s  interaction  with  a  technology  \nstimulates  passers-by  to  observe,  approach  and  engage  in  an  \ninteraction  themselves.  In  this  paper  we  explore  the  potential  \nfor  honeypot  efects  to  arise  in  the  use  of  mobile  augmented  \nreality  (AR)  applications  in  urban  spaces.  We  present  an  ob-\nservational  study  of  Santa\u2019s  Lil  Helper,  a  mobile  AR  game  that  \ncreated  a  Christmas-themed  treasure  hunt  in  a  metropolitan  \narea.  Our  study  supports  a  consideration  of  three  factors  that  \nmay  impede  the  honeypot  efect:  the  presence  of  people  in  \nrelation  to  the  game  and  its  interactive  components;  the  visi-\nbility  of  gameplay  in  urban  space;  and  the  extent  to  which  the  \ngame  permits  a  shared  experience.  We  consider  how  these  \nfactors  can  inform  the  design  of  future  AR  experiences  that  \nare  capable  of  stimulating  honeypot  efects  in  public  space.  \nCCS CONCEPTS \n \n\u2022 Human-centered computing \u2192 HCI theory, concepts \n \n \n \nand models. \n \n \nKEYWORDS \n \nAudience; Augmented reality; Honeypot efect; Public space. \n \n \n \n \nACM Reference Format: \n \nRyan M.

    "abstract": "In HCI, the honeypot effect describes a form of audience engagement in which a person's interaction with a technology stimulates passers-by to observe, approach and engage in an interaction themselves. In this paper we explore the potential for honeypot effects to arise in the use of mobile augmented reality (AR) applications in urban spaces. We present an observational study of Santa's Lil Helper, a mobile AR game that created a Christmas-themed treasure hunt in a metropolitan area. Our study supports a consideration of three factors that may impede the honeypot effect: the presence of people in relation to the game and its interactive components; the visibility of gameplay in urban space; and the extent to which the game permits a shared experience. We consider how these factors can inform the design of future AR experiences that are capable of stimulating honeypot effects in public space.",
