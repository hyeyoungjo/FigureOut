Today, consumers\nmainly use VR for entertainment applications including 3D\nmovies and games [16]. A large \ufb01eld of view (FOV), high\nvisual \ufb01delity as well as the visual and auditory encapsulation\ncan create truly immersive experiences with almost unlimited\nopportunities. Gamepads and novel tracked input devices are\nused to interact with the application or game.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor pro\ufb01t or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the \ufb01rst page.

    "abstract": "Entering text is one of the most common tasks when interacting with computing systems. Virtual Reality (VR) presents a challenge as neither the user's hands nor the physical input devices are directly visible. Hence, conventional desktop peripherals are very slow, imprecise, and cumbersome. We developed a apparatus that tracks the user's hands, and a physical keyboard, and visualize them in VR. In a text input study with 32 participants, we investigated the achievable text entry speed and the effect of hand representations and transparency on typing performance, workload, and presence. With our apparatus, experienced typists benefited from seeing their hands, and reach almost outside-VR performance. Inexperienced typists profited from semi-transparent hands, which enabled them to type just 5.6 WPM slower than with a regular desktop setup. We conclude that optimizing the visualization of hands in VR is important, especially for inexperienced typists, to enable a high typing performance.",
