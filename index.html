                    <div class="body">In our study, we focus on BIP caused by discontinuation of the VR experience to
                        ﬁll out questionnaires. Therefore, in alignment with Schwind et al. [74], we created an
                        immersive VE in which participants were required to engage with a playful tasks repeatedly at
                        different levels of realism and respond to questionnaires inside and outside VR. We recorded
                        physiological signals during the whole session, since they are more sensitive to assess BIPs
                        than subjective self-reports [89].</div>
                    <div class="body">The study design employs mixed methods and contains two independent variables:
                        questionnaire modality and ﬁdelity. The questionnaire modality describes the presentation of a
                        questionnaire, either as INVRQ or OUTVRQ. Since physiological responses are highly speciﬁc and
                        can vary drastically between participants we chose a within-subjects design with repeated
                        measures for the questionnaire modality. This also allows the participants to compare bot
                        assessment methods. The order of the questionnaire conditions was randomized. Fidelity is
                        operationalized as degree of immersion [10, 46, 74] with the levels low (LoFi) and high (HiFi).
                        Based on prior research which showed evidence that visual ﬁdelity fosters immersion and
                        therefore affects the sense of presence [9, 87, 104], we hypothesize that a switch from LoFi to
                        physical reality would cause a smaller BIP compared to switching from HiFi. To avoid transfer
                        effects, ﬁdelity was administered between-subjects.</div>
                    <div class="subsubtitle">The Virtual Environment</div>
                    <div class="body">In the VE, the player is located on a plateau in open space surrounded by three
                        crystals which are attacked by drone enemies. The task of the game is to shoot the drones with a
                        pistol using the VR controller. To eliminate a drone, the player is required to hit it twice.
                        This is to decelerate the body movement of the player and thus reduce artefacts in the
                        biosignals. We aimed to provide a sustained medium-intensity engagement with the game; players
                        should feel connected to the task while not being overly aroused or stressed. Therefore, we
                        balanced the game so that the player would lose the round within the last seconds if they did
                        not eliminate any drones. Since we attached biosensors to the non-dominant hand, we deliberately
                        designed the game to be playable with one hand only. To operationalize different levels of
                        presence, we altered the visual and aural ﬁdelity of the VE. For the HiFi variant (stylized), we
                        used high resolution textures, sound, physics simulation and particle effects (Fig. 1a). The
                        LoFi environment (abstract) only consisted of primitive mesh objects which approximated the HiFi
                        objects without particle effects nor sounds (Fig. 1b). We payed attention to design both ﬁdelity
                        variants with comparable difﬁculty and only altered the visuals and sounds with the same hidden
                        models for collision-detection. To avoid learning effects as confounds in the biosignals and
                        performance, the drones spawned randomly at two ﬁxed locations. Besides the altered ﬁdelity and
                        the randomized spawn-points, there were no differences in the VE between the trials. The
                        environment was implemented in Unity3D and run on a high-end PC with a HTC Vive Pro HMD at a
                        constant frame rate of 90 FPS.</div>
                    <div class="subsubtitle">inVRQ Design </div>
                    <div class="body">We employed the INVRQ tool, which was previously designed and evaluated by
                        Alexandrovsky and Putze et al. [3]. The design follows general guidelines from traditional UIs
                        [24, 79] and VR interface design [22, 34, 33, 64] and received high usability scores [3]. The
                        questionnaire is anchored in world space and users interact with a controller using a common
                        laser pointer metaphor (cf. Fig. 1c,1d). We kept INVRQS constant and in the same position in
                        both variants of the VE.</div>
                    <div class="subsubtitle">Recording of Physiological Signals</div>
                    <div class="body">We used a Mind Media NeXus 10 MKII biofeedback device1 with the BioTrace+ V2018A
                        software for recording of the physiological signals with a sampling rate of 128 Hz. The NeXus 10
                        was connected using a 5 m USB cable allowing the participants to move around freely in the
                        tracking space. We used a chest strap respiration sensor, a blood volume pressure (BVP) sensor
                        and a skin conductance (SC) sensor to measure electrodermal activity (EDA) on the non-dominant
                        hand of the participant. These biosignals are in alignment with physiological measures of
                        presence [53, 58, 59] and BIP [54, 85, 86].</div>
                    <div class="body">Figure 3 illustrates the recording setup: We attached the SC sensors using
                        adjustable velcro straps to the middle phalanx of ring and little finger which have the highest
                        SC responsiveness [77, 97]. To synchronize the recordings of the signals with the game, we used
                        audio signals and manual triggers. Before placement of the electrodes, the participants cleaned
                        their non-dominant hand with a wet wipe. To get a clear signal quality and reduce artifacts due
                        to movement, we briefed the participants not to use their non-dominant hand with the sensors and
                        to let it hang down during the whole study. A conductor helped the participants with fitting the
                        HMD.</div>
                    <div class="subsubtitle">Subjective Measures</div>
                    <div class="body">To assess player experience after each game round, we applied the Player
                        Experience of Need of Satisfaction (PENS) [66] questionnaire either using an inVRQ or outVRQ. It
                        consists of 21 items on a 7-point Likert scale with the subscales of autonomy, competence,
                        relatedness, presence, and intuitive control. With 21 items PENS is similar in length to other
                        questionnaires (e.g. PANAS, IPQ, NASA-TLX) used in previous user studies with inVRQs [45, 63,
                        76]. To assess potential differences in perceived sense of presence due to different
                        questionnaire modalities and to validate the “breakable experience”, we operated the igroup
                        presence questionnaire (IPQ) [70] after the third game rounds in each condition (2 × for each
                        participant). The IPQ consists of 14 items on a 5-point Likert scale with the subscales General
                        Presence (GP), Spatial Presence (SP), Involvement (INV) and Realism (REAL). We did not assess
                        the IPQ between trials because it is not sensitive for measuring a BIP [3, 74] and the game
                        rounds did not differ. We also collected self reports about game experience and usability with
                        both questionnaire modalities. Finally, the users ranked the BIP events by the degree of
                        distraction.</div>

                    <div class="body">Our study ﬂow is depicted in Figure 2 and consisted of the following states: 1.
                        Study preparation: Brieﬁng and complete consent form. Random assignment to a condition (HiFi or
                        LoFi) and order of the questionnaire modality. Attach physiological sensors and synchronize
                        biosignals with the game. Put on the HMD. 2. First questionnaire condition, steps A.-H. (INVRQ
                        or OUTVRQ). 3. Break (optional). 4. Second questionnaire condition, steps A.–H. (OUTVRQ or
                        INVRQ). 5. Conclusive questionnaire on a PC with demographics, ranking questionnaire modalities
                        and debrieﬁng.</div>
                    <div class="body">Each questionnaire condition contained the following steps: A. Put on the HMD and
