The\nsubjective experience of \u2018being there\u2019 as well as the ability\nto \u2018act there\u2019, even when one is physically situated in another\nplace, is known as presence [5, 21]. Relating to the percep-\ntion of VR, authors de\ufb01ne presence as \u201cthe sense of being in\nan environment\u201d [3] or \u201cthe outcome or a direct function of\nimmersion\u201d [17]. VR systems and applications are usually\ndesigned to maximize the experience of presence and often\nmake use of virtual body representations of users, also known\nas their avatars, to provide a realistic and familiar interface\nbetween the own body and the virtual environment.",
