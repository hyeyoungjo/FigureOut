They allow researchers to create\nsafe and replicable stimuli, thereby enabling rapid and safe\nempirical exploration of how people will respond to various\nroad situations and interface designs. A major challenge for\ndriving simulation is replicating the inertial forces and vehicle\ndynamics that are present in on-road driving\u2014particularly in\nlight of recent psychological studies that point to the impor-\ntance of inertial and vestibular cues to distance perception and\nsteering (please see [22], for a review). In the age of advanced\nautomation, another emerging dif\ufb01culty is that in-lab driving\nsimulators lose much of their ability to generate a sense of im-\nmersion and presence if the person using the simulator is not",

    "abstract": "Researchers and designers of in-vehicle interactions and interfaces currently have to choose between performing evaluation and human factors experiments in laboratory driving simulators or on-road experiments. To enjoy the benefit of customizable course design in controlled experiments with the immediacy and rich sensations of on-road driving, we have developed a new method and tools to enable VR driving simulation in a vehicle as it travels on a road. In this paper, we describe how the cost-effective and flexible implementation of this platform allows for rapid prototyping. A preliminary pilot test (N = 6), centered on an autonomous driving scenario, yields promising results, illustrating proof of concept and indicating that a basic implementation of the system can invoke genuine responses from test participants.",
