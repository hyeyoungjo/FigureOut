While most work on ad-\ndressing these limitations explores additional input techniques\nor modalities, this work focuses on the output challenges that\narise from small screen sizes of currently 1.5\u20131.8 (cid:48)(cid:48) (10\u201325%\nthe size of typical 5 (cid:48)(cid:48) smartphone screens).\nWatchThru extends the output capabilities of current smart-\nwatches into 3D with an additional 1.8 (cid:48)(cid:48) transparent screen\nthat complements the main touchscreen with graphics that can\nbe displayed \ufb02oating in mid-air (see Figure 1). WatchThru\ncan show different information on the two screens, based on",

    "abstract": "We introduce WatchThru, an interactive method for extended wrist-worn display on commercially-available smartwatches. To address the limited visual and interaction space, WatchThru expands the device into 3D through a transparent display. This enables novel interactions that leverage and extend smartwatch glanceability. We describe three novel interaction techniques, Pop-up Visuals, Second Perspective and Peek-through, and discuss how they can complement interaction on current devices. We also describe two types of prototypes that helped us to explore standalone interactions, as well as, proof-of-concept AR interfaces using our platform.",
