One  emerging  AR  type  uses  the \nfront-facing  camera  and  overlays  a  user\u2019s  face  with  digital \nfeatures that transform the physical appearance, making the \nuser look like someone else, such as a popstar or a historical \ncharacter. However, little is known about how people react \nto  such  stepping  into  character  and  how  convincing  they \nperceive it to be. We developed an app with two Egyptian \nlooks,  MagicFace,  which  was  situated  both  in  an  opera \nhouse  and  a  museum.  In  the  first  setting,  people  were \ninvited to use the app, while in the second setting they came \nacross  it  on  their  own  when  visiting  the  exhibition.  Our \nfindings  show  marked  differences  in  how  people  approach \nand  experience  the  MagicFace  in  these  different  contexts. \nWe  discuss  how  realistic  and  compelling  this  kind  of  AR \ntechnology is, as well as its implications for educational and \ncultural settings. \nAuthor Keywords \nAugmented  reality;  Opera  characters;  Interface  design;  In-\nthe-wild study.  \nACM Classification Keywords \nH.5.m.

So far, it has \nbeen  mainly  used  for  educational,  commercial  and  gaming \nlocation-based \nexample,  providing \napplications, \ninformation  about  buildings  and  landmarks,  and  signage \nabout places of interest. The recent craze, Pok\u00e9mon Go, has \ndemonstrated  its  popularity  as  a  gaming  platform,  where \nplayers  hunt  virtual  Pok\u00e9mon  creatures  in  real  life.  Most \nAR apps use the back-facing camera in smartphones/tablets",
