TNFT was designed to produce \nopportunities  for  interactors  to  experience  role-taking  and \ncharacter identification using design principles drawn from \nactor  training  and  theatrical  performance.  We  report  the \nresults of a pilot qualitative study of interactors using TNFT \nto  explore  the  elements  of  the  design  that  supported  or \nhindered  roleplaying  behavior.  We  identify  four  design \npatterns that supported roleplaying in the system: (1) using \nexplicit roles to set player expectations, (2) embracing the \n\u201cmask  and  the  mirror\u201d  effect,  (3)  attending  to  visual  and \ninteractional  details,  and  (4)  easing  the  player  gently  into \nthe  roleplaying  experience.  These  patterns  speak  to  a \nbroader  need \nthrough  explicit \nscaffolding  of  desired  player  behaviors in  digital  narrative \nexperiences. \nAuthor Keywords \nVirtual Reality; Interactive Digital Storytelling; Interactive \nPerformance; Roleplaying; Narrative; Drama \nCSS Concepts \n\u2022 Human-centered computing~Virtual reality   \u2022 Software\nand its engineering~Interactive games\nINTRODUCTION \nThe current discourse around interactive narratives and VR \nis  saturated  with  (contested)  claims  about  \u201cempathy\u201d  and \n\u201cperspective taking\u201d [15,18,39,43,58]. Theorists of VR and \nnarrative  are  invested  in  the  possibility  of  the  medium to \nsupport  some  sort  of  transformative  experience,  however \nthere  is  little  understanding  of  the  design  patterns  that \nsupport or deny roleplaying and character identification.
