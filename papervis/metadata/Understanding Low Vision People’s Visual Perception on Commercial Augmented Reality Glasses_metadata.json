Unlike blind people, \nlow vision people have functional vision and can potentially \nbenefit  from  smart  glasses  that  provide  dynamic,  always-\navailable visual information. We sought to determine what \nlow  vision  people  could  see  on  mainstream  commercial \naugmented  reality  (AR)  glasses,  despite \ntheir  visual \nlimitations  and  the  device\u2019s  constraints.  We  conducted  a \nstudy  with  20  low  vision  participants  and  18  sighted \ncontrols,  asking  them  to  identify  virtual  shapes  and  text  in \ndifferent  sizes,  colors,  and  thicknesses.  We  also  evaluated \ntheir  ability  to  see  the  virtual  elements  while  walking.  We \nfound  that  low  vision  participants  were  able  to  identify \nbasic  shapes  and  read  short  phrases  on  the  glasses  while \nsitting  and  walking.  Identifying  virtual  elements  had  a \nsimilar  effect  on  low  vision  and  sighted  people\u2019s  walking \nspeed,  slowing \nit  down  slightly.  Our  study  yielded \npreliminary  evidence  that  mainstream  AR  glasses  can  be \npowerful  accessibility  tools.  We  derive  guidelines  for \npresenting  visual  output  for  low  vision  people  and  discuss \nopportunities for accessibility applications on this platform.  \nAuthor Keywords \nAccessibility; augmented reality; user study; low vision.  \nACM Classification Keywords \nH.5.1. Information interfaces and presentation: Multimedia \nInformation Systems \nINTRODUCTION \nAccording \nthe  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and \nto \nPrevention (CDC), 3.3 million Americans who are 40 years \nold  and  older  have  low  vision.  A  person  has  low  vision  if \nshe  has  a  visual  impairment  that  adversely  affects  her \nability  to  perform  daily  activities  and  cannot  be  corrected \nwith  glasses  or  contact  lenses.  People  with  low  vision  can \nhave  a  variety  of  visual  conditions,  including  reduced \ncontrast  sensitivity,  loss  of  visual  field,  and  lower  visual \nacuity  [3].  Since  most  diseases  or  conditions  causing  low \nvision occur as people age, the number of low vision people",
