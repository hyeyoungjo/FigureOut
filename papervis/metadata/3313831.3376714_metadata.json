From a user perspective, \nVR should allow us to transform traditional screen-based pro-\nductions into embodied experiences, where one can directly \ninteract with the virtual world from \u201cinside\u201d [46]. However, \ndesigning the mechanics for the virtual world is not always \nstraightforward. Close-range interactions are particularly dif-\n\ufb01cult,  due  to  the  unpredictability  of  user  actions,  and  con-\nventional methods used in non-immersive environments, like \nscreen-based video games, extrapolate poorly to VR.",

    "abstract": "VR games offer new freedom for players to interact naturally using motion. This makes it harder to design games that react to player motions convincingly. We present a framework for VR sword fighting experiences against a virtual character that simplifies the necessary technical work to achieve a convincing simulation. The framework facilitates VR design by abstracting from difficult details on the lower \"physical\" level of interaction, using data-driven models to automate both the identification of user actions and the synthesis of character animations. Designers are able to specify the character's behaviour on a higher \"semantic\" level using parameterised building blocks, which allow for control over the experience while minimising manual development work. We conducted a technical evaluation, a questionnaire study and an interactive user study. Our results suggest that the framework produces more realistic and engaging interactions than simple hand-crafted interaction logic, while supporting a controllable and understandable behaviour design.",
