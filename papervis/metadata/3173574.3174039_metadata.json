Information  interfaces  and  presentation  (e.g.,  HCI):\nMultimedia  Information  Systems  - Artificial,  augmented,\nand virtual realities\nBACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\nCataract  is  a  clouding  of  the  lens  in  the  eye  that  occludes\nvision.  According  to  a  recent  assessment  by  the  World\nHealth Organization [26], cataract is responsible for 51% of\nblindness, representing 20 million people worldwide, which\nmakes it the current leading cause of blindness. Although the\nopaque lens material can be removed through microsurgery\nprocedures, it is very difficult for surgeons to master those\nskills because of following reasons:\n1. Absence of force feedback\nThe lens is suspended behind the iris by a ring of fibrous\nstrands  called  the  zonule  of  Zinn.  The  diameter  of  the\nzonule is 1 to 2 micrometers, and it can be dehisced if the\nlens is pushed excessively during surgery. The lens capsule\nis  only  2  to  28  micrometers  thick  and  can  be  easily torn\napart  without  any  resistance.  Due  to  these  anatomical\nproperties  of  the  lens,  cataract  surgery  mainly  relies  on\nvisual feedback rather than the force feedback utilized in\nthe other surgeries [7].\n2. Difficult to reproduce subtle movements\nThe surgical field in cataract surgery is approximately 10\nmm  in  both  diameter  and  depth.  Every  movement  is\nextremely  delicate  and  the  result  can  be  significantly",
