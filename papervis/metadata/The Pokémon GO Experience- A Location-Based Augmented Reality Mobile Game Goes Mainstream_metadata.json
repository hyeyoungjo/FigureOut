    "paragraph_containing_keyword": "ABSTRACT \nPok\u00e9mon GO is a location-based augmented reality mobile \ngame based on the Pok\u00e9mon franchise. After the game was \nlaunched globally in July 2016, it quickly became the most \nsuccessful  mobile  game  in  both  popularity  and  revenue \nlocation-based \ngeneration  at \naugmented  reality  game  to  reach  a  mainstream  status.  We \nexplore  the  game  experiences  through  a  qualitative  survey \n(n=1000)  in  Finland  focusing  on  the  positive  and  the \nnegative aspects of Pok\u00e9mon GO as told by the players. The \npositive  experiences  are  related  to  movement,  sociability, \ngame mechanics, and brand while the negative experiences \nemerge \ntechnical  problems,  unequal  gaming \nopportunities,  bad  behavior  of  other  players  and  non-\nplayers,  and  unpolished  game  design.  Interestingly,  the \naugmented reality features, safety issues or the free-to-play \nrevenue  model  did  not  receive  considerable  feedback.  The \nfindings are useful for academics and industry practitioners \nfor  studying  and  designing  location-based  augmented \nreality game experiences. \nAuthor Keywords \nGame  Experience;  Game  Design;  Augmented  Reality; \nLocation-Based; Pervasive Game; Mobile Game; Pok\u00e9mon \nGO; Qualitative Study  \nACM Classification Keywords \nHuman-centered  computing,  Human  computer  Interaction \n(HCI), Empirical Studies in HCI",
