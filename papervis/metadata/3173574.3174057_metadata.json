However,  the  momentary  experience  of \nexiting  VR  and  transitioning  back  to  the  real-world  is  not \nwell  understood.  Do  users  become  self-conscious  of  their \nactions upon exit? Are users nervous of their surroundings? \nUsing  explicitation  interviews,  we  explore  the  moment  of \nexit  from  VR  across  four  applications.  Analysis  of  the \ninterviews  reveals  five  components  of  experience:  space, \ncontrol, sociality, time, and sensory adaptation. Participants \ndescribed  spatial  disorientation,  for  example,  regardless  of \nthe complexity of the VR scene. Participants also described \na window across which they exit VR, for example mentally \nfirst and then physically. We present six designs for easing \nor  heightening  the  exit  experience,  as  described  by  the \nparticipants. Based on these findings, we further discuss the \n\u2018moment of exit\u2019 as an opportunity for designing engaging \nand enhanced VR experiences.  \nAuthor Keywords \nVirtual Reality; User Experience \nACM Classification Keywords \nH.5.m. Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI): \nMiscellaneous.  \nINTRODUCTION \nVirtual  Reality  (VR)  is  being  employed  to  provide  a  wide \nrange  of  experiences.  Recent  advances  in  commercial  VR \nheadsets  have  led  to  new  industry  attention  on  VR  games. \nIn  research,  VR  has  a  long  tradition  as  a  tool  for  studying \ncomplex phenomena (different perspectives and fears) [26] \nand,  increasingly,  as  a  technology  for  exploring  novel \nexperiences [7,9] and collaborations [18].  \nWhile  the  user  is  in  VR,  the  user  experience  is  well \nunderstood.  Research  has  explored  both  the  technical \nfactors  of  immersion  (e.g.,  [11,39])  and  the  experiential \nfactors  of  presence  (e.g.,  [36]).  After  exit,  the  mid-term \naftereffects  of  VR  have  also  been  explored  [1,38],  such  as",
