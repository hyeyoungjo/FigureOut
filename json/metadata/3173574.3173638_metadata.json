These videos are creating new media for enter-\ntainment [29], news and documentaries, real estate, data visu-\nalization [8], virtual tours [14], and free-viewpoint video [20].\nStereoscopic 360\u00b0 video, which provides a much greater sense\nof immersion than monoscopic video, is becoming increas-\ningly available due to many recent advances in camera tech-\nnology [2, 30], and new processing tools [22] and editing\ninterfaces [32, 33] are being developed for these videos.\nHowever, the extra sense of depth in stereoscopic VR video\ncan be problematic to users of VR video applications. Com-\nmon user interface (UI) widgets like video navigation, sub-\ntitles, annotations, and tool palettes are often rendered on\ntop of the video. Each widget must be rendered at a speci\ufb01c\nperceived depth, which is controlled by varying the disparity\n(difference in horizontal position) between the left and right\neye views. However, the perceived depth of the stereoscopic",

    "abstract": "Applications for viewing and editing 360\u00b0 video often render user interface (UI) elements on top of the video. For stereoscopic video, in which the perceived depth varies over the image, the perceived depth of the video can conflict with that of the UI elements, creating discomfort and making it hard to shift focus. To address this problem, we explore two new techniques that adjust the UI rendering based on the video content. The first technique dynamically adjusts the perceived depth of the UI to avoid depth conflict, and the second blurs the video in a halo around the UI. We conduct a user study to assess the effectiveness of these techniques in two stereoscopic VR video tasks: video watching with subtitles, and video search.",
