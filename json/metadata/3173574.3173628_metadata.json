A recent\ndevelopment focuses on mobile VR HMDs which are not based\non smartphones but offer an untethered headset with embedded\nhardware, inside-out tracking and some form of input capabilities\n(e.g. Intel Alloy). Both these device types enable the interaction\nscenario of Nomadic VR [18, 29], where users can immerse them-\nselves inside a virtual world wherever and whenever they wish.\nThis nomadic interaction scenario comes with several challenges\nsuch as the unknown and uninstrumented environment [18].\nSince current mobile VR HMDs are designed exclusively for the\nwearing user (HMD User), every other person in this environment",

    "abstract": "Mobile VR HMDs enable scenarios where they are being used in public, excluding all the people in the surrounding (Non-HMD Users) and reducing them to be sole bystanders. We present FaceDisplay, a modified VR HMD consisting of three touch sensitive displays and a depth camera attached to its back. People in the surrounding can perceive the virtual world through the displays and interact with the HMD user via touch or gestures. To further explore the design space of FaceDisplay, we implemented three applications (FruitSlicer, SpaceFace and Conductor) each presenting different sets of aspects of the asymmetric co-located interaction (e.g. gestures vs touch). We conducted an exploratory user study (n=16), observing pairs of people experiencing two of the applications and showing a high level of enjoyment and social interaction with and without an HMD. Based on the findings we derive design considerations for asymmetric co-located VR applications and argue that VR HMDs are currently designed having only the HMD user in mind but should also include Non-HMD Users.",
