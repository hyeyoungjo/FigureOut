Jour-\nneys can last for signi\ufb01cant durations, for example car journeys\nin UK last on average 22 minutes [17], with commutes lasting\n55 minutes [58]; in the USA, drivers spend 56 minutes a day on\naverage in-transit [76]. These journeys can be repetitive (e.g.\nthe commute to work), with travellers frequently noting that\nsuch trips are wasted time [24, 80].

    "paragraph_after_keyword": "interaction can offer some respite [33], journeys are often con-\nducted without the physical presence of friends or family, with\nthe car providing solitary personal space [24]. Entertainment\nand productivity options are limited to displays signi\ufb01cantly\nsmaller than those in the home or of\ufb01ce (e.g. phones, tablets,\nlaptops, dashboards and rear-seat systems [81]). In the speci\ufb01c\ncase of car journeys, these issues will gain increasing preva-\nlence given the arrival of fully autonomous cars, which would\nfree drivers from the driving task, and consequently increase\nthe occurrence of passenger experiences.\nWhile autonomous cars will allow for radical redesign of the\ncar interior (e.g. seating locations and internal display con\ufb01gu-\nrations [20]), passengers will still perceive themselves as being\nin a constrained space, with the physical limitations of the in-\nterior dictating what is possible to be rendered and displayed.\nMoreover, the passenger\u2019s visual perception of motion may\nbe compromised by use of these displays, through changes in\ngaze angle (e.g. looking down/away from windows) and occlu-\nsion (presenting content over windows, or occluding windows\nto enhance immersion [43]). This has implications for motion\nsickness, which in-part arises from the sensory mismatch of\nvisually and physically perceived motion [59, 85].\nMany people become travel sick when watching TV, reading\nor working in vehicles, meaning that they cannot use the time\nproductively. These problems will grow in number with the\narrival of autonomous cars [20, 19, 71]; the act of driving\nstops many people from feeling sick due to the anticipatory\ncues of being the driver [75] and without these cues people\nwho did not get sick will now do so. Consideration needs to\nbe given to how entertainment and productivity can be sup-\nported whilst minimizing motion sickness. Virtual Reality\n(VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Head Mounted Displays\n(HMDs) have the potential to signi\ufb01cantly expand the display\nspace, enabling immersive entertainment and workspaces that\ngo beyond the physical limitations of the car interior. Problem-\natically, VR HMDs also occlude visual perception of reality\n[44, 6] and thus the car\u2019s motion, and are likely to lead to\nsensory mismatch and, consequently, motion sickness. How-\never, assuming the orientation and velocity of the vehicle can\nbe tracked at low latency, HMDs have the potential to por-\ntray the vehicle motion virtually. Accordingly, for both VR\nHMDs, and passengers more generally, the problem of occlud-\ning the visual perception of motion, and the resultant sensory\nmismatch this causes, can be solved (as demonstrated in con-\nsumer VR rollercoasters which run over a known and precisely\ncontrolled route [77]). VR and AR HMDs are capable of con-\nveying the motion of the vehicle at all times, from all viewing\nangles. Consequently, the problem is then: how should these",
