The core idea is to translate the motion of ped-\naling on a mini exercise bike to a corresponding walking ani-\nmation of a virtual avatar while providing audio-based tactile \nfeedback on virtual ground contacts. We conducted an experi-\nment to evaluate the LUI and our novel anchor-turning rotation \ncontrol method regarding task performance, spatial cognition, \nVR sickness, sense of presence, usability and comfort in a \npath-integration task.  The results show that VR Strider has \na signi\ufb01cant positive effect on the participants\u2019 angular and \ndistance estimation, sense of presence and feeling of comfort \ncompared to other established locomotion techniques, such as \nteleportation and joystick-based navigation. A con\ufb01rmatory \nstudy further indicates the necessity of synchronized avatar \nanimations for virtual vehicles that rely on pedalling. \nAuthor Keywords \nVirtual reality, navigation techniques, locomotion user \ninterface, virtual walking \nCCS Concepts \n\u2022Human-centered  computing  \u2192  Human  computer  inter-\naction (HCI); \u2022Human computer interaction (HCI) \u2192 In-\nteraction techniques; \u2022Interaction paradigms \u2192 Virtual re-\nality; \nINTRODUCTION \nReal walking is usually considered as the most intuitive way \nof locomotion in real and virtual worlds, and has been found \nto be more presence-enhancing compared to other forms of \nlocomotion such as \ufb02ying or joystick-based navigation [46]. \nFurthermore,  walking  has  been  shown  to  be  superior  over \nother techniques for complex spatial tasks [32], cognitive map \nbuilding [33], and cognitive demands [25].  However, there \nare limitations of using walking as locomotion user interface",
