The aim is to extend the viewers\u2019\n\u201cscreen\u201d beyond the TV as part of a personalised companion\nexperience in order to aid content discovery, to provide inter-\nactive services, or enable the collection of analytics [10, 44].\nAugmented Reality (AR) technologies offer the potential to\ncreate new display surfaces in the living room for placing\ncontent such as an interactive information graphics for elec-\ntion coverage on the coffee table, a three-dimensional model\nof a dinosaur skeleton on a nearby wall while watching an\narchaeological documentary, or a presenter on the sofa next\nto the viewer explaining a Shakespearean drama. As part\nof an exploratory study, we used an optical head mounted\ndisplay (HMD), in conjunction with a TV, to explore a way\nto deliver synchronised sign language interpretations.\nThe distribution of signed content forms part of the ac-\ncess services offered by broadcasters. In the UK, British Sign\nLanguage (BSL) [12, 15] is the main language used in signed\ncontent while in Germany, Deutsche Geb\u00e4rdensprache (DGS)\n[17\u201319] is used. Traditionally, signed content is delivered as\na picture-in-picture video (in-vision) with a signer placed on\nthe bottom right corner of the TV. Although, functionally",

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) technology has the potential to extend the screen area beyond the rigid frames of televisions. The additional display area can be used to augment televisions (TVs) with extra information tailored to individuals, for instance, the provision of access services like sign language interpretations. We invited 23 (11 in the UK, 12 in Germany) users of signed content to evaluate three methods of watching a sign language interpreted programme - one traditional in-vision method with signed programme content on TV and two AR-enabled methods in which an AR sign language interpreter (a 'half-body' version and a 'full-body' version) is projected just outside the frame of the TV presenting the programme. In the UK, participants were split 3-ways in their preferences while in Germany, half the participants preferred the traditional method followed closely by the 'half-body' version. We discuss our participants reasoning behind their preferences and implications for future research.",
