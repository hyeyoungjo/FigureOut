With  MABLE \n(mobile application for behavioral learning and education), \nparents  can  provide  AR-assisted  feedback  by  changing  fa-\ncial  expressions  and  sound  effects.

A two-week long experiment with 36 \nparent-child  pairs  showed  that  compared  to  using  just  the \npuppet,  using  MABLE  showed  higher  amount  of  engage-\nment among preschoolers. For the effectiveness of parental \nmediation  in  terms  of  self-control,  our  data  showed  mixed \nresults. MABLE  had positive effects  in  that the amount of \nrule-compliance  increased  and  problematic  behaviors  de-\ncreased,  whereas  the  level  of  behavioral  dependency  on \nsmart media was not influenced. \nAuthor Keywords \nPreschoolers; rule compliance; engagement; parental medi-\nation; augmented reality (AR); smart media usage. \nACM Classification Keywords \nH.5.1.
