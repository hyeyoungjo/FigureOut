While  VR  eas-\nily allows changes to visual appearances, modifying haptic \nimpressions remains challenging. Existing passive haptic \ntechniques require access to a large set of tangible proxies. \nTo reduce the number of physical representations, we look \ntowards fabrication to create more versatile counterparts. In \na user study, 3D-printed hairs with length varying in steps \nof 2.5 mm were used to infuence the feeling of roughness \nand hardness. By overlaying fabricated hair with visual tex-\ntures, the resolution of the user\u2019s haptic perception increased. \nAs changing haptic sensations are able to elicit perceptual \nswitches, our approach can extend a limited set of textures \nto a much broader set of material impressions. Our results \ngive insights into the efectiveness of 3D-printed hair for \nenhancing texture perception in VR. \nCCS CONCEPTS \n\u2022 Human-centered computing \u2192 User studies; Haptic \ndevices; Virtual reality. \nKEYWORDS \ntexture perception; passive haptic feedback; 3D printing \nACM Reference Format: \nDonald Degraen, Andr\u00e9 Zenner, and Antonio Kr\u00fcger. 2019.
